Step-by-Step Guide to Install Deepin Style Cursor on Windows 11
Follow these steps to install and apply the Deepin Style cursor on your Windows 11 computer:

Step 1: Download the Deepin Style Cursor Pack
Go to a reputable website like DeviantArt or GitHub, where the Deepin Style cursor pack is available for download. Look for verified versions to avoid any security issues.
Download the cursor pack as a .zip file and save it to an accessible location on your computer, like your Desktop.
Step 2: Extract the Files
Right-click on the downloaded .zip file and select Extract All.
Choose a location to extract the files. You’ll typically get a folder containing several .cur and .ani files, each representing different cursor states (like pointer, hand, loading, etc.).
Step 3: Install the Cursor Pack
Open the Control Panel by typing it into the Windows search bar.

Go to Hardware and Sound > Mouse.

In the Mouse Properties window, go to the Pointers tab.

Click Browse, navigate to the folder where you extracted the cursor pack, and select the corresponding .cur or .ani file for each cursor state.

The cursor set includes options like Normal Select, Working in Background, Busy, Text Select, and Handwriting. Match each Windows cursor state with the appropriate file in the Deepin Style pack.
Once all cursors are set, click Save As, give it a name (e.g., “Deepin Style”), and click OK.

Step 4: Apply and Enjoy Your New Cursors
To finalize, click Apply and OK in the Mouse Properties window.
Your cursor should now change to the Deepin Style design, giving Windows 11 a refreshed, polished look.
Tips for Personalizing Further
To complete the look, consider combining the Deepin Style cursor with a suitable wallpaper or Windows theme that enhances the overall aesthetic. Windows 11’s dark mode works particularly well with Deepin’s subtle and clean cursor style, adding contrast and visibility.

Troubleshooting Common Issues
Cursors Not Showing Up Correctly: If some cursors revert to default after applying, make sure you saved the custom scheme in the Mouse Properties window.
File Errors: If you encounter errors when browsing for cursor files, check that the downloaded files are compatible with Windows 11.
Reverting to Default Cursors: If you wish to return to the original Windows 11 cursor set, go back to the Mouse Properties > Pointers tab, select Windows Default (System Scheme), and apply.
